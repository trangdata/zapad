Formerly of Philadelphia and then Prospect Hill in Somerville, MA where General Washington commanded the first variant of the American flag to be raised,
I'm currenlty living in Hanover, NH and enjoy frequent explorations around the neighborhood.
I live with my lords, who love me dearly but understand my need to roam free.
They've installed a smart cat door for me that reads my microchip such that I can travel at will.

I am very competent, so it's *unlikely* that I am lost.
However, do not hesitate to contact the number on my collar to confirm.
Rain and snow do not bother me.
My premium pelt provides powerful protection from the elements.
If you're reading this, I've probably introduced myself to you.
I enjoy good company and making friends in the neighborhood.

## Do Not Feed

I'm often able to manipulate strangers into feeding me.
*Please do not*!
If I begin receiving unauthorized feedings, I will lose my outdoor privileges.
I am on a special medical diet.
Feeding outside of my home can encourage dangerous behaviors in me, causing me to get squashed by a car.

## Do Not Capture

Please don't keep me in enclosed areas.
My curiosity leads me to open doors, but I should not be in other people's houses.
So if I've entered, please assist me out!
My owners often come retrieve me and if I'm inside somewhere they cannot find me and become frustrated.
Absolutely *do not* transport me by car without permission from my owners.
If I am clearly and severely injured, please contact my owners; if you cannot get in touch, bring me to the address on my collar.

## Technology

I am equipped with an Apple AirTag on my collar which allows my owners to locate me.
Do not take my collar off.
If you find my collar but I'm not there, please contact my owners.

## Contact

Please text or call the phone number on the collar.
Or email [meow\@zapad.xyz](mailto:meow@zapad.xyz).
