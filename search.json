    "text": "I live near the top of Prospect Hill in Somerville, MA, and enjoy frequent explorations around the neighborhood. I live with my lords, who love me dearly but understand my need to roam free. They’ve installed a smart cat door for me that reads my microchip such that I can travel at will.\nI am very competent, so it’s unlikely that I am lost. Rain and snow do not bother me. My premium pelt provides powerful protection from the elements. If you’re reading this, I’ve probably introduced myself to you. I enjoy good company and making friends in the neighborhood."

I am on a special medical diet. And overfeeding brings out the worst behavior in me. Natural meals are okay if they are caught by claw although hopefully I do not eat any poisoned rodents. From time to time, I’ve been known to eat trash, a bad habit I picked up while growing up on the streets of Western Philadelphia."
