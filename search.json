Best cat I’ve ever met. I used to love watching the cat from my window, seeing them hanging out with everyone in the park — from all walks of life, sometime playing with kids, sometime comforting sad looking lonely people late at night. Letting your cat roam free was a wonderful gift to the community.\n\n\n\nNeighbor Lise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey there neighbor, Vinal Ave-[neighbor] here, just wondering what your cat’s name is? Didn’t see it on the tag and some girls walking by said they just call him/her Fork haha. Super nice kitty though, first one I’ve gotten to hang with since losing mine a year ago, very much appreciated :)\n\n\n\nNeighbor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have enjoyed our brief encounters and your sweet cat, Zapad. Best of luck on your new journey.\n\n\n\nNeighbor Tori\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZapad’s the governor of Prospect Hill.\n\n\n\nNeighbor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is the coolest cat in town, I envy his freedom.\n\n\n\nAnonymous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is incredibly charming, I enjoyed meeting him!\n\n\n\nAnonymous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Formerly of Philadelphia and then Prospect Hill in Somerville, MA where General Washington commanded the first variant of the American flag to be raised, I’m currenlty living in Hanover, NH and enjoy frequent explorations around the neighborhood. I live with my lords, who love me dearly but understand my need to roam free. They’ve installed a smart cat door for me that reads my microchip such that I can travel at will.\nI am very competent, so it’s unlikely that I am lost. However, do not hesitate to contact the number on my collar to confirm. Rain and snow do not bother me. My premium pelt provides powerful protection from the elements. If you’re reading this, I’ve probably introduced myself to you. I enjoy good company and making friends in the neighborhood."
