- subtitle: "We'll miss Zapad so much. Best cat I've ever met. I used to love watching the cat from my window, seeing them hanging out with everyone in the park — from all walks of life, sometime playing with kids, sometime comforting sad looking lonely people late at night. Letting your cat roam free was a wonderful gift to the community."

Super nice kitty though, first one I've gotten to hang with since losing mine a year ago, very much appreciated :)"
